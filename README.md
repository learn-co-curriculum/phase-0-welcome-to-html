# Welcome to HTML

## Preview

In the next few lessons, we'll be introducing you to HTML (HyperText
Markup Language).

HTML is a _documentation-based_ technology. The word _documentation_ probably
inspires a mental image of someone carrying heaps of papers, folders, files.
But what is a _document_ in the digital realm?

We'll start our exploration of HTML by thinking about files and learning the
vocabulary technologists use to discuss them in the process of creating HTML
documents. This will assist your searches for help and your ability to interact
with professionals on the topic.

We'll then proceed to a collaborative lab where you'll be guided in editing a
simple HTML document. The point here is not to memorize the full detail of
HTML's vocabulary, but to experience the joy and excitement of being able to
adjust and customize HTML.

After that, we'll learn a core set of HTML features that will enable you to create
simple HTML documents with less-explicit guidance. Around this time, you'll then
begin tying these discoveries together and will start creating your first
HTML documents.

## Repetition &amp; Getting Stuck

In the lessons ahead, many of the ideas are deliberately repeated. You might not 
get "attributes" the first time you see them, but, after some hands-on experience,
they'll make sense the second time you see them.

## Beyond

At the close of the unit, you'll be ready to learn a series of HTML expressions
that will allow you to create a meaningful web page.
